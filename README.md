# Test-of-GNN4-aptamer-predicting

# It is a simple test which aims to find the problems and struggles may hard to be solved.
## 1.physic restraint is significant
  The model will try to keep the most atoms at the same position for lower Loss without basic physic logical against;
  If the laws are simple that can not consider the specific phenomenons which may also cause the error;
### As far as I consider, in the next update plan this program will focus on these laws:
    ① Energy restraint or fomula restraint
      It is common and easy to connect the lowest energy compound with the most stable confomation at most time, and in fact the molcular dynamic compute method or molecular docking is maybe the symbol of this conceive
    ② Force restraint
      Energy is not the most important elements if we know bio enough, cause most kind of protein and nuclear acid can switch bwtween different conformations which may just need a little energy as activate key. Thus consider the force balence is also a method that can be consider as a upper calssifier than energy restraint.
    ③ The principle of least action
      To be frankly, I think the principle of least action is also a good classifier that can be connected with the Energy restraint, cause one equals (kinetic energy + potential energy), another equals (PE - KE). Especailly, if I follow the MD method to build the LOSS in the NN FOR APTAMER CONFOMATION PREDICTING  
## 2.The framework of code and ability of coding is important
    ah! please forgive the shit framework of my code, it is also a chance to review the knowledge that may forget!!!
### 2.1 take def apart is SIGNIFICANT! make whole program easy to read and write!

## 3.Problems
### 3.1 the attribute of atoms and bind should be set correctly
